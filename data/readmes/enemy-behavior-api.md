A BepInEx library for Hollow Knight: Silksong that reads any enemy's PlayMaker FSMs by
reflection, works out which states are attacks and which are movement, and hands that to
other mods as a structured schema they can observe, tune, or drive.

No per-enemy list. Point it at a GameObject and it tells you what that enemy can do.


## Status

There is no per-enemy support list. Discovery derives everything from the object in front
of it, so an enemy this has never seen works exactly like one it has. The numbers below are
**sample size, not coverage**: 18 enemy kinds, 16 scenes and 2 bosses across two recorded
sessions (Moss Grotto, The Marrow, Bell Beasts).

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Enemy discovery, FSM scanning, state/action/parameter extraction | **Works** - measured |
| Per-instance handles, authority arbitration, event stream | **Works** - measured |
| Harmony gates on `Fsm.DoTransition` and `Fsm.SwitchState` | **Works** - no crashes across 18 enemy kinds |
| Attack/movement classification | **Usable, imperfect** - calibrated against real sessions |
| Decision-state detection (for Override) | **Works** - finds branch states on bosses |
| Speed extraction | **Partial** - 59/152 movements resolve a speed |
| Damage extraction | **Poor** - 48/53 attacks still report 0 |
| **Influence tier** (parameter writes, revert-on-dispose) | **Works, lightly tested** |
| **Override tier** (`Fire`, transition veto, passlist) | **Works, lightly tested** - two bugs found and fixed in real use |

Every recorded survey session ran Observe-only, so the higher tiers carry none of that
mileage. What they do have is real use: Override is hand-driven by the
[Enemy Puppeteer](https://github.com/faarisaahmed/enemy-puppeteer), which is how both the
v0.2.2 hard freeze and the v0.2.3 multiplayer desync were found and fixed.

The risk still worth naming: if the Override passlist is wrong, a mod holding Override
could stop an enemy's death transition and make it effectively immortal. The passlist has
not been seen to fail - but it has not been exercised across many enemies either.

### Known-wrong things

- `DamageAmount` is 0 for most attacks. Silksong keeps hero damage on persistent
  `DamageHero` components rather than in FSM actions, and resolving which child a state
  arms is still unreliable.
- Contact-damage enemies (Bone Roller) report **0 attacks**, correctly by the current
  definition - they have no attack *state*, they simply hurt to touch. The schema has no
  way to express that yet.
- Some enemies move via C# `Walker`/`Crawler` components that FSMs only start and stop, so
  there are no velocity actions to read. Handled by signal, not yet verified in game.
- Classification is calibrated on early-game enemies. Late-game and Act 3 enemies are
  entirely unmeasured.

## Helping

The single most useful contribution is a survey file.

1. Drop both DLLs in `BepInEx/plugins/` (see [Install](#install))
2. Play normally - the survey records by itself and writes every 30 seconds
3. Send the JSON from `BepInEx/plugins/EnemyBehaviorApi.Survey/surveys/`

It is strictly read-only: it never writes to an enemy, so nothing behaves differently
while it runs. Areas and bosses not listed under [Status](#status) are the most valuable.

If a classification looks obviously wrong for an enemy you know, say so - that judgement is
the ground truth the classifier gets tuned against.

## Install

Requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) for Silksong.

1. Download from [Releases](../../releases)
2. `EnemyBehaviorApi.dll` → `BepInEx/plugins/EnemyBehaviorApi/`
3. `EnemyBehaviorApi.Survey.dll` → `BepInEx/plugins/EnemyBehaviorApi.Survey/`
4. Launch. The survey starts on its own; `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` confirms it.

`EnemyBehaviorApi.Example.dll` is optional and **not needed to help with data**. It
demonstrates all three tiers, which means it writes to and drives enemies through paths
nothing has tested. It is off unless you set `EnableTierDemo = true`, and you should leave
it that way for now.

The survey ships as a separate assembly so "this cannot touch your enemies" is a property
of the binary rather than a promise in a readme - it contains no call to any write-capable
API method, which you can check yourself with any IL disassembler.

Config lands in `BepInEx/config/` after the first run. `VerboseLogging = true` on the API
is worth setting - without it, discovery messages go to `LogDebug`, which BepInEx's disk
log excludes by default.

## Why it works

Silksong builds enemy behaviour out of PlayMaker FSMs assembled from roughly 2,200 typed
action classes. Those class names describe mechanisms rather than creatures - `ChaseObject`,
`DistanceFly`, `SetDamageHero`, `SpawnObjectFromGlobalPool` - and the same few dozen recur
across every enemy in the game. So "what is this state doing?" is answerable by looking at
which actions it holds, without knowing anything about the enemy it belongs to.

Two facts about PlayMaker do most of the work:

- **State changes funnel through two methods, and they split cleanly.** `Fsm.DoTransition`
  runs *before* a state change is queued and returns a bool, so refusing there means the
  transition simply never happens - that is the Override tier's veto. `Fsm.SwitchState` runs
  when a change commits, which makes it the place to watch - that is the Observe tier's event
  stream. Vetoing `SwitchState` instead hard-freezes the game; v0.2.2 fixed that.
- **`FsmStateAction.Enabled` is public and settable, and action fields are plain
  reflection targets.** That is the Influence tier: change the numbers a designer typed in,
  without touching the enemy's decision-making.

## The three tiers

| Tier | Can | Exclusive? |
|---|---|---|
| **Observe** | Read the profile, subscribe to state changes | No |
| **Influence** | Tune speeds, timings, damage, branch weights | No |
| **Override** | Suppress the enemy's decisions and fire transitions | **Yes, per instance** |

Authority is scoped to one **enemy instance**, never to a kind of enemy and never globally.
A combat-overhaul mod driving the boss and a pet mod charming one husk in the same room
are not in conflict, and nothing in the API makes them think they are.

Override is the only exclusive claim, because two mods firing transitions into one FSM
produces behaviour neither asked for. Asking for Override on an enemy someone else holds
gets you Influence instead of a refusal - check `handle.Tier` on the result. When the
incumbent releases, the claim passes to whoever was waiting.

### What Override actually suppresses

`OverridePolicy.SuppressDecisions` (the default) vetoes only transitions **leaving a
decision state** - the states holding a `SendRandomEvent` or fanning out to several
attacks. Everything else runs normally: attacks complete, recoveries play, hit reactions
fire, the enemy still dies when killed. It simply stops choosing, and waits for you.

That is usually what "take control" should mean. The enemy still looks and feels like
itself, because its animations, timings and interruptibility all live in states you are not
touching.

`OverridePolicy.SuppressAll` vetoes everything you did not fire. Total puppetry - and you
now own reacting to being hit, too.

Either way, a small passlist (death, stun, recoil, land, idle…) always gets through.
Without it, an Override holder makes the enemy immortal by accident: block every
transition and the death state never runs.

## Using it

```csharp
[BepInDependency("com.faaris.enemybehaviorapi")]
public class MyMod : BaseUnityPlugin
{
    void Awake()
    {
        EnemyBehavior.EnemyAppeared += enemy =>
        {
            // Keep the handle alive for as long as you want the events. Disposing it here
            // would unsubscribe before the enemy had done anything.
            var handle = EnemyBehavior.Claim(enemy, "com.example.mymod", AuthorityTier.Observe);
            _handles[enemy.InstanceId] = handle;

            foreach (var attack in handle.Profile.Actions)
                Logger.LogInfo($"{attack.DisplayName}: {attack.Shape}, {attack.DamageAmount} dmg");

            handle.StateChanged += (_, e) =>
            {
                if (e.Behavior is ActionDescriptor a)
                    Logger.LogInfo($"incoming: {a.DisplayName}");
            };
        };

        EnemyBehavior.EnemyGone += enemy => _handles.Remove(enemy.InstanceId);
    }
}
```

Influence - the enemy still decides, it just decides faster:

```csharp
var handle = EnemyBehavior.Claim(enemyGo, MyGuid, AuthorityTier.Influence);

foreach (var p in handle.Profile.Movements.SelectMany(m => m.Parameters)
                        .Where(p => p.Name.Contains("speed")))
{
    handle.TryGetParameter(p.Id, out float current);
    handle.TrySetParameter(p.Id, current * 1.5f);
}
```

Override - you decide:

```csharp
var handle = EnemyBehavior.Claim(enemyGo, MyGuid, AuthorityTier.Override);

var attack = handle.Profile.Actions
    .Where(a => a.TelegraphFor == null)      // skip wind-ups; fire the real entry point
    .OrderByDescending(a => a.DamageAmount)
    .First();

handle.Fire(attack.Id);
```

**Always dispose the handle.** Disposing reverts every parameter and action-enable that
handle wrote, releases Override, and unsubscribes. A handle left on an enemy that dies gets
cleaned up with the instance - but until then it holds Override against everyone else.

`Samples/ExampleMod` is a working mod exercising all three tiers; press F12 in game to
cycle.

## Schema

`ActionDescriptor` and `MovementDescriptor` are separate types, linked back to an
`EnemyProfile` by `EnemyId`, so a mod that only cares about attacks never filters a mixed
list. A state that is both - a charge that damages on contact - appears in both lists over
the same `StateRef`.

Every descriptor carries a `Confidence` from 0 to 1 and the raw `ActionTypes` the
classification was made from. Low confidence means the signals were close, which is honest:
those are the charge-attacks and the dash-with-a-hitbox that genuinely are both. Filter on
it rather than trusting every descriptor equally.

`SchemaVersion.Current` goes up on any schema change; `MinimumCompatible` goes up only on a
breaking one. Check `SchemaVersion.IsCompatible` at startup.

## Replicated transitions

Anything that replays enemy state from elsewhere — a multiplayer mod applying the
authoritative host's FSM state, a replay system, a save restore — must wrap those transitions:

```csharp
using (EnemyBehavior.AuthoritativeScope())
{
    fsm.SendEvent(replicatedEvent);
}
```

Those transitions are not the enemy deciding anything, so suppressing them is always wrong —
but at the point the gate sees them they are indistinguishable from its own decisions.

This is not hypothetical. SSMP replicates enemy state on non-host clients through `Fsm.Event`
and `PlayMakerFSM.SendEvent`, both of which reach `Fsm.DoTransition`. With any Override claim
held locally, the gate vetoes them and the enemy silently stops receiving state — desyncing in
a way that looks like the networking is broken rather than like an authority conflict.

## Annotations

Reflection gets ordinary enemies right. Bosses are hand-built, spread across several FSMs,
and reliably confuse a generic classifier - so they get corrected in JSON rather than in
code. That is the whole point: the reflection engine stays general instead of accumulating
an if-chain of special cases.

Drop `*.json` in `BepInEx/plugins/EnemyBehaviorApi/annotations/`. Every file is loaded and
merged in filename order, so a mod can ship its own corrections without editing anyone
else's. Keys are the enemy id, then `path/FsmName/StateName`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "enemies": {
    "Silk Boss": {
      "primaryFsm": "Control",
      "ignoreFsms": ["Damage Response", "Audio"],
      "decisionStates": ["Control/Choose Attack"],
      "states": {
        "Control/Lunge": {
          "classify": "both",
          "displayName": "Lunging Bite",
          "shape": "Melee",
          "mode": "Dash",
          "note": "Hitbox is on an always-active child, so there was no ActivateGameObject to find."
        },
        "Control/Flinch": { "classify": "none" }
      },
      "parameters": {
        "var:Control/Attack Cooldown": { "min": 0.2, "max": 6.0 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Every field is optional - a null leaves discovery's answer alone, so files stay small and
record only the disagreement. `"classify": "none"` removes a false positive;
`"classify": "attack"` on a state discovery ignored creates the descriptor from scratch.
See `annotations/example.json` for every field with commentary.

While writing annotations, `EnemyBehavior.ReloadAnnotations(dir)` rebuilds profiles without
a restart.

## Building

Needs the .NET SDK and a local Silksong install with BepInEx.

```bash
dotnet build EnemyBehaviorApi/EnemyBehaviorApi.csproj
```

Output is copied into `BepInEx/plugins/EnemyBehaviorApi/`. The game path defaults to a
macOS GOG install - point it somewhere else with a gitignored `LocalPaths.props` beside
`Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight Silksong</GamePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

```

## Known limits

- **`Fsm.SetState` bypasses suppression.** The veto lives on `Fsm.DoTransition`, and
  `SetState` does not route through it - so an enemy that drives itself with `SetState` keeps
  going even under `SuppressAll`. That is the safe direction to be wrong in: slightly less
  control, rather than a frozen game.
- **Identity is name-based.** Enemy ids come from the prefab name with Unity's `(Clone)`
  and ` (1)` suffixes stripped. Two genuinely different enemies sharing a name need an
  annotation to tell apart.
- **`PrimaryFsm` is a heuristic** - whichever FSM holds the most classified states. Right
  for enemies with one `Control` FSM plus small helpers; bosses with several real behaviour
  FSMs need `primaryFsm` set.
- **Parameters address actions by index.** Stable within a build, not across one. Writes
  check the action's type name first, so a game update turns a moved action into a failed
  call rather than a corrupted enemy.
- **The classifier is tuned against four enemy kinds** (Moss Grotto: Bone Thumper,
  MossBone Fly, MossBone Crawler, MossBone Cocoon) - a subset of the 18 it has been
  *measured* across. It is measured, not guessed - but four is a small sample, and no boss
  is in it. Expect to keep adjusting
  `SignalTable`; `EnemyProfile.AllStates` carries the score behind every verdict so you can
  see exactly why something was missed.
- **A sustained attack's damage is armed one state earlier.** Discovery propagates a live
  hitbox one transition hop, which covers the usual wind-up-then-commit shape. An attack
  that stays armed across three or more states will read as movement after the second.
- **Annotations outrank the classifier and are stamped `Confidence = 1.0`.** A state key
  that does not exist is now rejected with a warning rather than silently inventing a
  behaviour, but a *wrong* annotation on a real state is still taken at face value.
